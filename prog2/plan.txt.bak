1. The Program is going to set up a server that takes in pairs of clients and sets them up to play with eachother. the game that they're playing is a word game that will require the clients to make words out of the randomly generated set that the server provides each round. The Server will check the word against a dictionary it has and the perviously entered words, the first client to send an invald word wins the round. The game continues until a player wins 3 rounds.
I will implament this assingment by starting with the server pairing off clients, then working on the communication between the server, and the two clients then finally all the game logic.

2. I suspect that the hardest part of this program will be getting the server to pair up the clients before forking and going back to wait for more clients.
